# Quick-Computer-Options

Really simple menu that lets you do certain things to your computer
 (written in C#)

Features:
- 6 options on a menu (Shut Down, Force Shut Down, Restart, Sleep, Lock, and Sign Out)
- Ability to be pinned to taskbar for convenience
- You can only run one instance of the program

Usage:
- Load it up once, pin it to taskbar if you wish, and keep it running in the background (extremely low memory usage (basically none)) then go to it when you need to leave or turn off the PC!
